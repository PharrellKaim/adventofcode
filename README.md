# adventofcode

This repository is for the AdventofCode 
I will do the adventofcode this year (2033) in the programming language python to train my skills.
My graduation project will be in python, so i want to improve my skills in this region.

note: i renamed the repo because i want to solve all years of aocd
in different languages, so they are not solved by time
